<div>The theoretical framework of dynamic heterogeneity considers how ecological ecosystems interact with social ecosystems. A key focus of this integration is the idea of spatial heterogeneity, the interaction of of different ecosystems across space, both between and within scales [levels?]. In this ambitious attempt, the framework considers human ecosystems as  simply the choices that individuals, households, organizations, and institutions make about their spatial locations and activities. This paper problematizes this overly simplistic understanding of human ecosystems as the "social" component that complements the ecological, especially for topics such as environmental justice. First, we point to the concept of uneven development as an important and overlooked scholarly tradition. Uneven development, and the broader geography and political economy canon [too snide?], demonstrates the inherent inequality that individuals, households, organizations, and institutions have in decided their&nbsp; own spatial location and the locations of their activities due to the control [?] of land markets. Thus, and second, we show how the use dynamic heterogeneity of misses important historical aspects in the shaping of various "heterogeneities" and the forms in which they persist today. Using a historical analysis of redlining, federal public housing, and a new housing market typology, we show how market forces are obdurate in the formation of urban social space and their influence on ecological and human ecosystems b. Lastly, we show how the problems of social housing&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
