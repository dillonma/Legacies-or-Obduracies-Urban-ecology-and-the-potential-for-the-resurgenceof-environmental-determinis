<div>The theoretical framework of dynamic heterogeneity considers how ecological ecosystems interact with social ecosystems. A key focus of this integration is the idea of spatial heterogeneity, the interaction of of different ecosystems across space and both between and within scales. In this ambitious attempt, the framework considers human ecosystems as the simply the choices that individuals, households, organizations, and institutions make about their spatial locations and activities. This paper problematizes this overly simplistic understanding of human ecosystems as the "social" component that complements the ecological. First, we point to the concept of uneven development,&nbsp; == Thus, and second, we show how the framework of dynamic heterogeneity is operationalized,&nbsp;</div>
